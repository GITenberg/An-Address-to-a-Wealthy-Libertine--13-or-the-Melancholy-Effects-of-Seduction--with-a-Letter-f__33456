3</span>An Address, &amp;c.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, Sir; I do these
lines impart<br />
With every pang that can corrode the heart;<br />
Bring to your mind a dismal scene late past,<br />
And let that guilty Amour be your last.<br />
Think of my friend that was of late so gay,<br />
By your vile arts dishonour&rsquo;d and away;<br />
From every joy that animates this life,<br />
The tender mother and the happy wife.<br />
A husband&rsquo;s frowns, a father&rsquo;s burning tears,<br />
For Stella&rsquo;s folly much increase their cares.<br />
A brother mourns, in solitude forlorn,<br />
To hear his Stella meet reproof and scorn:<br />
In tears he cries, my sister&rsquo;s late disgrace<br />
Will plant a stigma on the female race.<br />
Those friends so late that used to Stella stray,<br />
Now bend their courses far another way.<br />
She mourns in privacy her honour flown,<br />
And sighs to find illicit scenes are known.<br />
These sorrowing truths I feelingly renew,<br />
And know, oh guilty man! they rise from you.<br />
Can all your wealth lost honour ever gain?<br />
That, Sir, is scorn&rsquo;d&mdash;it is the impious stain<br />
You&rsquo;ve brought on Stella, to the end of life,<br />
And robs her all the comforts of a wife.<br />
Abandon&rsquo;d man you must atone for all,<br />
Ere life is o&rsquo;er on God for mercy call.<br />
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Your mind is harass&rsquo;d by reflection&rsquo;s
gale,<br />
That oft to you its bitterness exhale:<br />
Tempted by folly every scene pursue,<br />
That dissipation can expose to view.<br />
The softer pleasures that enrich the mind,<br />
That learning dictates, from you lag behind;<br />
Its cruel sport that bears a sov&rsquo;reign sway,<br />
To them and such like them you waste the day.<br />
Know, Sir, that wealth an&rsquo;t given to us here,<br />
To bring to infamy the British fair.<br />
Too much, I fear, you wanton hours employ,<br />
The needy woman daily to decoy.<br />
Too many wantons now disgrace this Isle,<br />
Whose bad example off the young beguile;<br />
I hope that plans to stop them will increase,<br />
And her that now is wretched rest in peace.<br />
Your gen&rsquo;rous family will ever gain,<br />
Affection&rsquo;s tribute while we life retain:<br />
Pure is the vine, except a leaf or two,<br />
Soon they&rsquo;ll decay and be no more in view.<br />
Disgrac&rsquo;d, disown&rsquo;d, to foreign lands they&rsquo;ll
fly,<br />
The censur&rsquo;d objects of the Deity.<br />
Wealth cannot stop the torrent of reproach,<br />
Tho&rsquo; screen&rsquo;d from Britons by a gaudy coach;<br />
Its inmate oft tho&rsquo; clad in rich array,<br />
Meets hoots and hisses as he rides away;<br />
Till spleen, that canker of the human heart,<br />
Makes him oft wish he could from life depart.<br />
<!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>It is a scourge offended laws can&rsquo;t give,<br />
The worst of torments whilst its object live;<br />
Sometimes it stops our vices as they rise,<br />
While chaster thoughts the wav&rsquo;ing mind supplies.<br />
Oft does a parent with paternal care,<br />
His only Daughter with affection rear;<br />
Soon as the time arrives his cares to pay,<br />
A vile seducer takes his gem away;&mdash;<br />
Wafts her to infamy of every kind,<br />
Then leaves the object with a tortur&rsquo;d mind.<br />
Still does her heart with pure affection burn,<br />
Wish to a father&rsquo;s roof again to turn;&mdash;<br />
Just at that period&mdash;lucre tempts again,<br />
And the weak vessel totters on the main:<br />
She reels, she sinks, from chaste affections view,<br />
To taste the draught of bitterness anew.<br />
Some vile procuress with a demon&rsquo;s skill,<br />
In a short period gains her to her will;<br />
Till grown familiar to a harlot&rsquo;s life,<br />
Quote inebriety to banish strife;<br />
Becomes familiar to a vicious plan,<br />
Adds to the charmers in the siren&rsquo;s den;<br />
To liquor fly to banish thoughts of home,<br />
And nightly forc&rsquo;d for ways and means to roam.<br />
Sweet health is banish&rsquo;d and she finds too late,<br />
Some dismal bridewell soon must be her fate;<br />
All means are fled, the staff of life to gain,<br />
To bridewell hurried with remorse and pain.<br />
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>A pass is granted,&mdash;to her father sent,<br />
Where she is foster&rsquo;d from the element.<br />
A tender parent kiss the long lost child,<br />
Assures forgiveness tho&rsquo; by grief turn&rsquo;d wild.<br />
Soon as the mind to calmer scenes invite,<br />
He bless the hour that brought his lost to sight.<br />
A scene like this came lately to my ear,<br />
I know the parent and his worth revere.<br />
Frequent do parents cause the great distress,<br />
That on their daughters unexpected press.<br />
The mother drains her pockets very low,<br />
That Miss may make a gaudy flippant show;<br />
To country balls she often bends her way,<br />
And is allowed with cards and dice to play.<br />
View but the manners of the modern belle,<br />
And see if they don&rsquo;t levity foretell:<br />
The bosom oft appears too much in view,<br />
Sweet modesty is forc&rsquo;d to bid adieu:<br />
To her chaste dictates she cannot attend,<br />
Indeed they do not deem her as a friend.<br />
Mark how they roll their lively eyes about,<br />
Just like her Ladyship when at a rout.<br />
A piece of music next the parlour grace,<br />
While vanity is striding on apace:<br />
So swift she flies that almost time outrun;<br />
By her man&oelig;uvres oft the fair&rsquo;s undone;<br />
Miss cannot look on any but a squire,<br />
Or dress&rsquo;d up coxcombs, only them admire;<br />
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>An honest farmer&rsquo;s son they call a clown,<br />
Likes none but puppies living in a town;<br />
Such creatures, soon as wedded, only strive<br />
How to jog on and keep the game alive:<br />
Careless who suffers if they can but live,<br />
Wanting still more than prudent parents give;<br />
All wishes gratified,&mdash;in hopes that Miss<br />
Will soon enjoy the matrimonial bliss.<br />
A prudent living man is known to say,<br />
For me such bawbles dress too fine and gay;<br />
She&rsquo;d squander money much against my will,<br />
In paying milliner&rsquo;s enormous bill.<br />
Such conduct in a parent may be wise,<br />
Where good estates can all his wants supplies;<br />
The ill effects that rise from such a plan,<br />
Is were stern poverty assails the man.<br />
Parents there are who often live this way,<br />
Although two shillings in the pound can&rsquo;t pay.<br />
Soon as their creditors do sharply press,<br />
The lovely maidens feel extreme distress;<br />
No lover then to sooth the drooping eye,<br />
When poverty is seen from them they fly:<br />
Unfit to baffle with the frowns of life,<br />
And greatly more so for to be a wife.<br />
Then does the wealthy Libertine succeed,<br />
Furnish their pockets known to be in need;<br />
Takes Miss from home to grace a chaise and pair,<br />
While the unhappy parents nurse despair.</p>

<i>Miss Maria C***</i>, <i>to her Parents at</i></h2>
<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pen I take, my wretched
fate to state,<br />
Pardon, oh pardon, tho&rsquo; a vile ingrate;<br />
Your daughter late so innocent and gay,<br />
Was by a vile seducer led astray<br />
From those chase precepts by you taught to know,<br />
That he who sets above knows all below;<br />
Either on earth or in the heavenly skies,<br />
Each substance falls or as he wishes rise.<br />
I fell a victim to unchaste desires,<br />
And feel those sorrows vengeance now requires,<br />
After I left a parent&rsquo;s house and home,<br />
Induced with wicked Henry to roam;<br />
That sweet society my bosom knew,<br />
From me that instant bade a long adieu.<br />
Time, I much fear, will not that balm restore;<br />
Its fled from me and will return no more.<br />
I know that sweet compassion fills your mind,<br />
And to forgiveness ever was inclin&rsquo;d;<br />
Take then your daughter to your arms again,<br />
And she from latent vices will abstain.<br />
With pious thoughts she&rsquo;ll pass the day away,<br />
Till stern reproof is banish&rsquo;d far away;<br />
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

In every mansion when Maria&rsquo;s there;<br />
Soon as the vengeance of her sting is cast,<br />
The scoffers arrogance no longer last;<br />
Too true I know that woes I&rsquo;m doom&rsquo;d to bear,<br />
The unfeeling frown the virgin&rsquo;s haughty sneer;<br />
In time they&rsquo;ll vanish when its known I rove,<br />
In virtue&rsquo;s path with innocence and love.<br />
My prayers I&rsquo;ll offer to the throne on high,<br />
And live as ordered by the Deity.<br />
Lately I met my Mother&rsquo;s upper maid,<br />
To ask her questions I was much afraid;<br />
Yet ere I bade the honest girl adieu,<br />
Nature compell&rsquo;d me to inquire of you:<br />
She said my mother fell a prey to grief,<br />
And that no medicine could give relief;<br />
In stating this a tear escaped her eye.<br />
Return she cried, then heaved a tender sigh:<br />
I will return and ere her spirits fled,<br />
Press my lov&rsquo;d mother on her couch or bed.<br />
For pity&rsquo;s sake write me a line to say,<br />
If I to you may speedy bend my way;<br />
This boon is all I ask and now I crave,<br />
A parent&rsquo;s blessing ere I meet the grave.</p>

In their happy retreat mirth wide abound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown to ill nature or spleen.</p>
<p class="poetry">May Isaac and many that live near the town,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This Christmas most cheerfully meet;<br />
To chat o&rsquo;er a glass at the Falcon or Crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Join&rsquo;d by others that at dwell in the
street.</p>
<p class="poetry">Both Landlords endeavour strangers to
please,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By keeping of liquors the best;<br />
With very soft beds that you may lay at ease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When disposed to adjourn for to rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">At Pulham Market, this motto remain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us always be merry thro&rsquo; life,<br />
Drink success to our King again and again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To banish dull care pain and strife.</p>
<h2>To the Memory of<br />
MR. SELF,<br />
<span class="smcap">late of</span><br />
<i>PULHAM MARKET HALL</i>.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tear of regret was
observed all around,<br />
When our neighbour and friend was consigned to the ground;<br />
If penury hung round the Cottager&rsquo;s door,<br />
He ne&rsquo;er would forget to remember the poor.<br />
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>So cheerful in converse you always would find,<br />
Neither spleen or ill nature could harass his mind;<br />
Till age made its inroads he&rsquo;d join with the gay,<br />
At manly amusements to gladden the day.<br />
In most friendly meetings for him they would call,<br />
For I can say with truth he was liked by us all;<br />
Good news for his country would him much pleasure bring,<br />
For no subject in Britain rever&rsquo;d more his King.<br />
His conduct and actions would plainly foretell,<br />
As a husband or parent but few did excel.<br />
He was always a friend to the labouring poor,<br />
To serve them at all times no one could strive more.<br />
In all parish concerns he was found to be just,<br />
And ne&rsquo;er was the man that dishonoured his trust,<br />
May the Angel that note all our errors above,<br />
Blot out our lov&rsquo;d friends thro&rsquo; angelical love:<br
/>
May his spirit be numbered with those of the blest,<br />
The moment grim death planted darts in his breast.<br />
May his Children be strangers to every strife,<br />
That too frequent attend many mortals thro&rsquo; life;<br />
And when it shall choose the Almighty to call<br />
Them from earthly troubles may he pardon them all.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
